This simulation package dates back to the mid-1990s and is developed primarily at Sandia National Laboratory. Although LAMMPS does not approach the performance of GROMACS (due to a lack of rigorous GPU optimization), it remains one of the most popular simulation codes as it provides perhaps the greatest flexibility of any open-source molecular dynamics code. \n",

As with our systems on Wednesday, we will need to pass a force field to apply when saving so that all the necessary information is provided in our data file to run the simulation. The standard OPLS force field (which we used for our bulk alkane systems on Wednesday) has been shown by Allen and Rowley to overestimate the dynamic viscosity of linear alkanes. However, they showed that by reducing the value of the hydrogen σ from 2.5Å to 2.38Å the agreement was significantly improved. Thus, we will use the Allen-Rowley modification to the OPLS force field for our system."

    "From the above results, we see that the value of the strain rate where the viscosity begins to become underestimated is dependent on the chain length, with longer chains realizing these effects at lower strain rates. Based on these results, a strain rate of 0.01 should be sufficient to yield a reliable viscosity estimate for alkanes with ≤ 10 backbone carbons. We will pass this as an argument to the execution of the LAMMPS script in the command below.\n",
