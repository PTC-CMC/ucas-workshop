    "1. A server, which is invoked when running `$ jupyter notebook` from the command line\n",

    "    - They can be ran over a network as well\n",

    "\n",
    "Kernels, on the other hand, are what control each notebook. Every Jupyter Notebook launched will have its own kernel. This kernel will handle the calls to the server and will be responsible for the execution of the code contained in the cells. You will not have to interact with the kernel at all, this is handled behind the scenes."
