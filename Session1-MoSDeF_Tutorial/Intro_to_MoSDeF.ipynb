    "This tutorial is designed to introduce you to the primary mission of mBuild - to facilitate the creation of complex molecular systems in a flexible fashion that allows system chemistry to be easily modulated. You will learn about the hierarchical data structure of mBuild `Compounds` and will have the ability to play around with some pre-built mBuild classes to observe how system structure can be changed by providing a few simple top-level variables."

    "### Hierarchical design approach\n",
    "\n",
    "mBuild uses a [composite design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern) to approach the creation of complex molecular systems. This yields the following features:\n",
    "* Molecules feature a tree-like hierarchy (as shown in the figure below)\n",
    "* All components in the hierarchy feature a common data structure (an mBuild `Compound`)\n",
    "* The lowest level of the hierarchy (the 'leaves') are referred to as `Particles` and are typically individual atoms\n",
    "* Atomic positions are maintained only at the `Particle` level; higher level components can compute properties based on contained `Particles`\n",
